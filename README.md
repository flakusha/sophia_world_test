# Sophie World Test Application
## Running application
The easiest way to run application is:

`cargo run -- --input <PATH_TO_JSON_FILE>`

## Minor commentaries
There are some commentaries regarding implementation details in the code.

I have used panic! macro to handle errors, but if there are better way to do
this I'm able to rewrite these parts of code.

I have used Blender3D to visually test rectangles' intersections.
